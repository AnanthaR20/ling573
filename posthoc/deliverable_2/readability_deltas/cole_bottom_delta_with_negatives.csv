SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Protection From Tobacco 
Addiction Act of 1996''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use account for 
        approximately 450,000 deaths each year in the United States.
            (2) Cigarette smoking accounts for approximately 
        $65,000,000,000 each year in lost productivity and health care 
        costs.
            (3) Tobacco products are as addictive as cocaine and 
        heroin.
            (4) Each day in the United States, approximately 3,000 
        children try their first cigarette, many of whom will become 
        addicted and will die prematurely.
            (5) The tobacco industry spends over $6,000,000,000 each 
        year to promote and advertise its products using images of 
        sexual attraction, sophistication, athletic abilities, and good 
        health.
            (6) The present advertising and promotional themes used by 
        the tobacco industry strongly influence youth tobacco use and 
        it is in the Government's interests to prohibit tobacco 
        advertising and promotion to discourage the use of tobacco by 
        the Nation's youth.
            (7) In spite of the well established and well known dangers 
        of tobacco products, the tobacco industry has for years denied 
        that their products cause disease or are addictive.
            (8) Of adult smokers, 82 percent smoked their first 
        cigarette before the age of 18. Of young people who become 
        regular smokers, 70 percent regret their decision to smoke.
            (9) Voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry, which 
        have been attempted for more than 30 years, have been shown to 
        be ineffective.

SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON TOBACCO ADVERTISING, PROMOTION, AND PACKAGING.
