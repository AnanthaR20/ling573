2994,"Human Trafficking Prioritization Act This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking of the Department of State will be more effective in carrying out duties mandated by Congress in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and can do so without an increase in either personnel or budget, if: (1) the Office's status is changed to that of a Bureau within State; and (2) the Office is headed by an Assistant Secretary with direct access to the Secretary of State, rather than an Ambassador-at-Large. The bill amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to change the status of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to that of the Bureau to Combat Trafficking in Persons.  State must submit to Congress a report detailing:   for each current Assistant Secretary of State position, the exact title and length of designation as Assistant Secretary and whether that designation was legislatively mandated or authorized and, if so, the relevant statutory citation; and whether State intends to designate one of the Assistant Secretary of State positions as the Assistant Secretary of State to Combat Trafficking in Persons and the reasons for that decision.   The bill prohibits subsequent inclusion for more than one consecutive year on the special watch list of countries whose compliance with minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking is full, partial, or insignificant of any country that:  was included on the list for four consecutive years after enactment of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, and was subsequently included on the exclusive Tier 3 list of countries not making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with such standards.   No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated for diplomatic and consular programs to carry out this bill.",(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to: (1) replace provisions establishing the Office of Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons within the Department of State with provisions establishing the Bureau to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons within the Department of State; and (2) repeal provisions terminating the Office of Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.,"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Human Trafficking Prioritization 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The International Labor Organization estimates that 
        nearly 21 million people are subjected to modern slavery around 
        the world at any given time and that the majority of the 
        enslaved are women and girls.
            (2) Congress authorized the creation of a Department of 
        State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons in 
        the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (Division A of 
        Public Law 106-386) in order to directly assist the Secretary 
        of State in his or her effort to coordinate a United States 
        Government interagency response to domestic and international 
        trafficking in persons.
            (3) The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons 
        monitors trafficking worldwide and produces the online and 
        printed versions of the annual Trafficking in Persons Report, 
        which is Congress' primary resource for human trafficking 
        reporting, analysis, and recommendations on the United States 
        and 186 countries around the world.
            (4) The annual Trafficking in Persons Report contains tier 
        rankings of each country on which it reports, and these tier 
        rankings have become an essential diplomatic tool for promoting 
        protection for victims, prevention of trafficking, and 
        prosecution of perpetrators.
            (5) Some countries have openly stated, and many others have 
        confided, that dramatic improvements in the country's human 
        trafficking record were directly related to avoidance of a low 
        tier ranking in the annual Trafficking in Persons Report.
            (6) Ambassador Mark Lagon, former Ambassador-at-Large to 
        Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (2007-2009), 
        testified before the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, 
        Global Human Rights, and International Organizations of the 
        Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives on 
        April 18, 2013, that ``[T]he State Department does a tremendous 
        job in producing a report which tells it like it is, offering 
        objective rankings. Yet at times it pulls punches, typically 
        due to the urging of regional specialists rather than the TIP 
        Office's dedicated experts on trafficking.''.
            (7) Ambassador John Miller, former Ambassador-at-Large to 
        Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (2002-2006), recently 
        stated that, ``Upgrading the status of the Office to a Bureau 
        will not create additional bureaucracy--it will simply give 
        JTIP and the Ambassador-at-Large who heads it equal standing 
        with regional and functional bureaus at the State Department. 
        That standing is absolutely essential for the issue to remain a 
        priority, especially when multiple U.S. interests are 
        engaged.''.
            (8) The tier ranking process authorized by Congress in the 
        Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 has been in some 
        instances compromised by the Office to Monitor and Combat 
        Trafficking subordinate stature within the Department of State.
            (9) It is essential for Congress and the Secretary of State 
        to be accurately informed regarding United States and foreign 
        country successes and failures in the fight against human 
        trafficking.
            (10) The diplomatic power and credibility of the 
        Trafficking in Persons Report is based on rigorous scholarship 
        and scrupulous application of the minimum standards for the 
        elimination of human trafficking and is undermined by 
        political, rather than factual, tier rankings.
            (11) Strong and effective anti-slavery policy requires that 
        officials from the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking 
        have equal hierarchical standing with State Department regional 
        bureaus and direct access to the Secretary of State.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking of the 
        Department of State will be more effective in carrying out 
        duties mandated by Congress in the Trafficking Victims 
        Protection Act of 2000 if the Office status is changed to that 
        of a Bureau within the Department hierarchy;
            (2) the change in status from Office to Monitor and Combat 
        Trafficking to a Bureau can be accomplished without increasing 
        the number of personnel or the budget of the current Office;
            (3) a Bureau to Monitor and Combat Trafficking would be 
        more effective in carrying out duties mandated by Congress in 
        the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 if the Bureau 
        were headed by an Assistant Secretary with direct access to the 
        Secretary of State, rather than an Ambassador-at-Large; and
            (4) the Secretary of State should review the current use of 
        the 24 Assistant Secretary positions authorized by section 
        1(c)(1) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 
        (22 U.S.C. 2651a(c)(1)) and make appropriate revisions, 
        consolidations, and eliminations, to ensure that those 
        positions reflect the highest Departmental needs and foreign 
        policy priorities of the United States, including efforts to 
        combat trafficking in persons.

                and inserting ``Bureau''; and

        ``Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking'' and inserting 
        ``Bureau to Combat Trafficking in Persons''.

SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native 
Communities Recognition and Compensation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) in 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to recognize and settle 
        the aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to the land Alaska 
        Natives had used for traditional purposes;
            (2) that Act awarded approximately $1,000,000,000 and 
        44,000,000 acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for the 
        establishment of Native Corporations to receive and manage the 
        funds and land;
            (3) pursuant to that Act, Alaska Natives have been enrolled 
        in 1 of 13 Regional Corporations;
            (4) most Alaska Natives reside in communities that are 
        eligible under that Act to form a Village or Urban Corporation 
        within the geographical area of a Regional Corporation;
            (5) Village or Urban Corporations established under that 
        Act received cash and surface rights to the settlement land 
        described in paragraph (2) and the corresponding Regional 
        Corporation received cash and land that includes the subsurface 
        rights to the land of the Village or Urban Corporation;
            (6) the southeastern Alaska communities of Haines, 
        Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell are not listed 
        under that Act as communities eligible to form Village or Urban 
        Corporations, even though the population of those villages 
        comprises greater than 20 percent of the shareholders of the 
        Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska and display historic, 
        cultural, and traditional qualities of Alaska Natives;
            (7) the communities described in paragraph (6) have sought 
        full eligibility for land and benefits under that Act for more 
        than 3 decades;
            (8) in 1993, Congress directed the Secretary of the 
        Interior to prepare a report examining the reasons why the 
        communities listed in paragraph (6) had been denied eligibility 
        to form Village or Urban Corporations and receive land and 
        benefits pursuant to that Act;
            (9) the report described in paragraph (8), published in 
        February, 1994, indicates that--
                    (A) the communities listed in paragraph (6) do not 
                differ significantly from the Southeast Alaska 
                communities that were permitted to form Village or 
                Urban Corporations under that Act;
                    (B) the communities are similar to other 
                communities that are eligible to form Village or Urban 
                Corporations under that Act and receive land and 
                benefits under that Act--
                            (i) in actual number and percentage of 
                        Native Alaskan population; and
                            (ii) with respect to the historic use and 
                        occupation of land;
                    (C) each such community was involved in advocating 
                the settlement of the aboriginal claims of the 
                community; and
                    (D) some of the communities appeared on early 
                versions of lists of Native Villages prepared before 
                the date of the enactment of that Act, but were not 
                included as Native Villages under that Act;
            (10) the omissions described in paragraph (9) are not 
        clearly explained in any provision of that Act or the 
        legislative history of that Act; and
            (11) on the basis of the findings described in paragraphs 
        (1) through (10), Alaska Natives who were enrolled in the 5 
        unlisted communities and the heirs of the Alaska Natives have 
        been inadvertently and wrongly denied the cultural and 
        financial benefits of enrollment in Village or Urban 
        Corporations established pursuant to that Act.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to redress the omission of 
the communities described in subsection (a)(6) from eligibility by 
authorizing the Native people enrolled in the communities--
            (1) to form Urban Corporations for the communities of 
        Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell under the 
        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); 
        and
            (2) to receive certain settlement land and other 
        compensation pursuant to that Act.

1615) is amended by adding at the end the following:

        Native Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and 
        Wrangell, Alaska, may organize as Urban Corporations.
            ``(2) Effect on entitlement to land.--Nothing in this 
        subsection affects any entitlement to land of any Native 
        Corporation established before the date of enactment of this 
        subsection pursuant to this Act or any other provision of 
        law.''.

SEC. 4. SHAREHOLDER ELIGIBILITY.

1607) is amended by adding at the end the following:

and Wrangell.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall enroll to each of 
        the Urban Corporations for Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, 
        Tenakee, or Wrangell those individual Natives who enrolled

        Petersburg, Tenakee, or Wrangell, respectively.

        on or before March 30, 1973, shall receive 100 shares of 
        Settlement Common Stock in the respective Urban Corporation.
            ``(3) Natives receiving shares through inheritance.--If a 
        Native received shares of stock in the Regional Corporation for 
        Southeast Alaska through inheritance from a decedent Native who 
        originally enrolled to the Native Village of Haines, Ketchikan, 
        Petersburg, Tenakee, or Wrangell and the decedent Native was 
        not a shareholder in a Village or Urban Corporation, the Native 
        shall receive the identical number of shares of Settlement 
        Common Stock in the Urban Corporation for Haines, Ketchikan, 
        Petersburg, Tenakee, or Wrangell as the number of shares 
        inherited by that Native from the decedent Native who would 
        have been eligible to be enrolled to the respective Urban 
        Corporation.

        subsection affects entitlement to land of any Regional

1606) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (j)--
