SHORT TITLE.

Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Cavernous angioma, also termed ``cerebral cavernous 
        malformations'' or ``CCM'', affects an estimated 1,500,000 
        people in the United States.
            (2) Cavernous angioma is a devastating blood vessel disease 
        that is characterized by the presence of vascular lesions that 
        develop and grow within the brain and spinal cord.
            (3) Detection of cavernous angioma lesions is achieved 
        through costly and specialized medical imaging techniques. 
        These techniques are often not readily available where patients 
        live, and require sedation for children and disabled adults.
            (4) Cavernous angioma is a common type of vascular anomaly, 
        but individuals may not be aware that they have the disease 
        until the onset of serious clinical symptoms. In the genetic 
        forms, they may not be aware that it may be passed on to their 
        children.
            (5) Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may 
        experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden 
        death.
            (6) Due to limited research with respect to cavernous 
        angioma, there is no treatment regimen for the disease other 
        than brain and spinal surgery.
            (7) Some individuals with cavernous angioma are not 
        candidates for brain surgery. No alternative treatment option 
        is available for such individuals.
            (8) There is a shortage of physicians who are familiar with 
        cavernous angioma and affected individuals may find it 
        difficult to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate care.
            (9) Due to the presence of a specific disease-causing 
        mutation, termed the ``common Hispanic mutation'' that has 
        passed through as many as 17 generations of Americans descended 
        from the original Spanish settlers of the Southwest in the 
        1590s, New Mexico has the highest population density of 
        cavernous angioma in the world. Cavernous angioma affects 
        thousands of individuals in New Mexico and with ancestry in New 
        Mexico.
            (10) Other States with high rates of cavernous angioma due 
        to the common Hispanic Mutation include Texas, Arizona, and 
        Colorado.
            (11) To address the public health threat posed by cavernous 
        angioma in New Mexico and throughout the United States, there 
        is a need to identify institutions capable of running clinical 
        trial for this debilitating brain disorder.
