SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Federal, State, and local governments spend billions of 
        dollars annually on the Nation's transportation needs.
            (2) Congestion on the Nation's roads costs over 
        $74,000,000,000 annually in lost work time, fuel consumption, 
        and costs of infrastructure and equipment repair.
            (3) On average on-road-vehicles contribute 30 percent of 
        nitrogen oxides emissions.
            (4) It is estimated that staying at home to work requires 3 
        times less energy consumption than commuting to work.
            (5) It was recently reported that if an identified 10 to 20 
        percent of commuters switched to teleworking, 1,800,000 tons of 
        regulated pollutants would be eliminated, 3,500,000,000 gallons 
        of gas would be saved, 3,100,000,000 hours of personal time 
        would be freed up, and maintenance and infrastructure costs 
        would decrease by $500,000,000 annually because of reduced 
        congestion and reduced vehicle miles traveled.
            (6) The average American daily commute is 62 minutes for a 
        44-mile round-trip (a total of 6 days per year and 5,808 miles 
        per year).
            (7) The increase in work from 1969 to 1996, the increase in 
        hours mothers spend in paid work, combined with a shift toward 
        single-parent families resulted in families on average 
        experiencing a decrease of 22 hours a week (14 percent) in 
        parental time available outside of paid work they could spend 
        with their children.
            (8) Companies with teleworking programs have found that 
        teleworking can boost employee productivity 5 percent to 20 
        percent.
            (9) Today 60 percent of the workforce is involved in 
        information work (an increase of 43 percent since 1990) 
        allowing and encouraging decentralization of paid work to 
        occur.
            (10) In recent years, studies performed in the United 
        States have shown a marked expansion of teleworking, with an 
        estimate of 19,000,000 Americans teleworking by the year 2002, 
        5 times the amount in 1990.

        individual is not in a teleworking arrangement bears to 12. For 
        purposes of the preceding sentence, an individual shall be
