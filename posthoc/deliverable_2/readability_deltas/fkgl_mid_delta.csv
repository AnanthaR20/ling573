SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``SMA Treatment Acceleration Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the number one genetic 
        killer of children under the age of 2.
            (2) SMA is an inherited and often fatal disease that 
        destroys the nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement, 
        which affects crawling, walking, head and neck control, and 
        even swallowing.
            (3) It is estimated that SMA occurs in nearly 1 of every 
        6,000 births and is therefore similar in incidence and severity 
        to other well-known genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis 
        and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, both of which may also benefit 
        from additional focus and progress on SMA.
            (4) SMA is caused by the mutation of a single gene. This is 
        extremely advantageous for genetic screening and therapeutic 
        development. The gene mutation that causes SMA is carried by 
        one in every 40 people, or approximately 7,500,000 Americans. 
        Each child of 2 carriers of the mutant gene has a 1 in 4 chance 
        of developing SMA.
            (5) The discovery of the gene responsible for the disease, 
        SMN1, as well as a disease modifying ``back-up'' SMN2 gene has 
        opened the door to new SMA treatments. Modulating genes exist 
        not only for SMA but also for other genetic disorders, 
        including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Parkinson's, and 
        Alzheimer's disease. The modulation of these genes might be 
        expected to impact these disorders. Success with SMN2 induction 
        for SMA will serve as an important proof of principle and 
        impetus for ongoing research in these other conditions.
            (6) Based on the advanced genetic understanding of SMA, the 
        disease was selected by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
        and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 
        (NINDS) as the prototype for the National Institutes of 
        Health's accelerated drug discovery effort, singling out SMA as 
        the disease closest to treatment of more than 600 neurological 
        disorders.
            (7) In 2003, the National Institute of Neurological 
        Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) established the Spinal Muscular 
        Atrophy Project: A Collaborative Program to Accelerate 
        Therapeutics Development for SMA. The SMA Project's unique 
        collaborative process between private, public, and non-profit 
        partners provides a model translational research program that 
        can be replicated to accelerate the development of safe and 
        effective treatments for a wide variety of disorders.
            (8) National non-profit organizations dedicated to finding 
        a treatment and cure for SMA continue to provide substantial 
        private funding and are collaborating with private 
        biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical companies, and 
        clinical investigators to identify new drug compounds and 
        facilitate the rapid translation of promising new therapies to 
        individuals with SMA. The aforementioned investment by national 
        non-profit organizations towards finding a treatment and cure 
        for SMA is approximately equal, on an annual basis, to the 
        resources committed by the Federal Government.
            (9) A Food and Drug Administration-approved SMA animal 
        model exists that closely mimics the human disease. A number of 
        therapeutics have been identified which are effective in animal 
        models of spinal muscular atrophy.
            (10) There is an urgent need to provide Federal support 
        enabling investigators to mount national clinical trials to 
        demonstrate that these treatments are safe and effective for 
        SMA patients.
            (11) The establishment and support of a national clinical 
        trials network and a data coordinating center will promote 
        rigorous patient evaluation using common protocols and allow 
        investigators to study large numbers of patients to provide 
        answers more rapidly than individual sites acting alone.
            (12) There is a demonstrated need for greater interagency 
        coordination on SMA research and involvement by additional 
        government partners to support the ongoing work of NINDS on the 
        SMA Project as well the work of private SMA voluntary 
        organizations, including most notably the need for active 
        engagement by the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
        Development (NICHD), along with support from the National 
        Center for Research Resources, the Centers for Disease Control 
        and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the 
        Health Resources and Services Administration
            (13) Despite such landmark legislation as the Orphan Drug 
        Act and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, additional 
        incentives for industry to engage early in the drug development 
        process and through to drug approval are warranted for diseases 
        as severe and devastating in infant and children populations as 
        SMA.
            (14) Educating the public and health care community 
        throughout the country about this devastating disease is of 
        paramount importance and is in every respect in the public 
        interest and to the benefit of all communities. Furthermore, 
        greater awareness of SMA may lead to the identification of pre-
        symptomatic SMA-afflicted children, which has significant 
        benefits relative to clinical trials and the search for a 
        treatment and cure.
