SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-Cent 
Coin Redesign Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the 
        Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during 
        the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's 
        history.
            (2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County, Kentucky, on 
        February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency 
        through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and 
        commitment to the United States.
            (3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham 
        Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.
            (4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice 
        toward none and with charity for all.
            (5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the 
        country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 
        1865.
            (6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of 
        Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for 
        accomplishing the ``American dream'' through honesty, 
        integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.
            (7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of 
        the birth of Abraham Lincoln.
            (8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood 
        in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in 
        Washington, D.C.
            (9) The so-called ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 
        on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse 
        design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.
            (10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the 
        talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to 
        design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting 
        a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.
            (11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ``Lincoln 
        cent'', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the 
        original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing 
        mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial 
        in Washington, D.C.
            (12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President 
        Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of 
        the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 
        1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of 
        the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.

SEC. 3. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.

    (a) In General.--During the year 2009, the Secretary of the 
Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following 
design specifications:
            (1) Obverse.--The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue 
        to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham 
        Lincoln.
            (2) Reverse.--The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 
        different designs each representing a different aspect of the 
        life of Abraham Lincoln, such as--
                    (A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;
                    (B) his formative years in Indiana;
                    (C) his professional life in Illinois; and
                    (D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.
    (b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in 2009.--
            (1) Order.--The 1-cent coins to which this section applies 
        shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in 
        subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar 
        quarter of 2009.
            (2) Number.--The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of 
        such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the 
        number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the 
        designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.
    (c) Design Selection.--The designs for the coins specified in this 
section shall be chosen by the Secretary--
            (1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln 
        Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and
            (2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory 
        Committee.

SEC. 4. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.

    The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after December 
31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's 
preservation of the United States of America as a single and united 
country.

SEC. 5. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS THE 1909 
              PENNY.

    The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with 
the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such 
number as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic 
purposes.

SEC. 6. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.

     It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor David 
Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from 
previous American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original 
form and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins 
issued in 2009.",19.956,13.174,9.895,23.143,16.771,37.159,22.979,15.142,9.895,24.674,18.172,32.46,3.0229999999999997,1.968,0.0,1.5309999999999988,1.4009999999999998,-4.698999999999998

SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Brownfields Housing and Community 
Renewal Development Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Addressing the problem of contaminated abandoned 
        industrial or commercial properties by funding programs that 
        encourage the reuse of such properties must continue to be a 
        priority of this country.
            (2) Brownfields grant programs funded through the 
        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are utilized for 
        environmental assessment, planning, job training, and cleanup.
            (3) EPA brownfields programs are not adequate to 
        rehabilitate, demolish, or redevelop structures.
            (4) The Department of Housing and Urban Development is an 
        appropriate agency to provide grants to redevelop contaminated, 
        abandoned or underutilized buildings, which pose not only a 
        possible health risk but also impact a community's quality of 
        life.
            (5) Local communities need additional redevelopment 
        programs that provide new flexibility to organizations to be 
        part of community development efforts.
            (6) The Congress should fund appropriate Federal programs 
        that allow communities to redevelop their neighborhoods and 
        improve the quality of life in the surrounding areas.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to empower local 
communities and their partners to clean and redevelop brownfields in 
their communities by providing--
            (1) flexibility for the development of local plans to 
        address brownfields problems; and
            (2) access to economic development grant funds.

              REDEVELOPMENT.
