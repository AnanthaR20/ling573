SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services 
        personnel are a vital component of the first responders across 
        the United States.
            (2) The 800,000 volunteer firefighters and emergency 
        medical service personnel in the United States save lives and 
        property everyday.
            (3) The national financial savings resulting from volunteer 
        firefighting and emergency medical services has been calculated 
        at more than $37,000,000,000 each year.
            (4) Many volunteer fire stations and emergency medical 
        services organizations in the United States face growing 
        challenges as volunteers contend with increased competition for 
        their time from their jobs, families, and other 
        responsibilities.
            (5) Some State and local governments provide financial 
        incentives to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical 
        services personnel, such as retirement benefits and tuition 
        assistance. Unfortunately, many communities that rely on 
        volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services 
        personnel, especially rural and low-income communities, do not 
        have the resources to provide such incentives.
            (6) There is an important role for the Federal Government 
        and the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration 
        in supporting volunteer firefighters and emergency medical 
        services personnel, including providing funds to contribute to 
        incentives for the recruitment and retention of volunteers.
