    This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury-Safe Seafood Act of 2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants, waste 
        incinerators, and other anthropogenic sources continues to 
        contaminate inland waterways and territorial waters of the 
        United States;
            (2) mercury accumulates in fish as methylmercury and is 
        passed on to humans that eat those fish;
            (3) methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin that, even in 
        small quantities--
                    (A) can cause serious damage to the human central 
                nervous system and adverse effects on many other 
                systems in the human body;
                    (B) is especially harmful to pregnant women and 
                young children; and
                    (C) puts an estimated 60,000 newborns at risk for 
                adverse neurodevelopmental effects each year in the 
                United States from in utero exposure;
            (4) certain commercial seafood species can have dangerously 
        high levels of methylmercury, as evidenced by Food and Drug 
        Administration data acquired in the 1990's, up to the time that 
        the agency discontinued domestic sampling in 1998;
            (5) the Food and Drug Administration's long-standing action 
        level of 1.0 parts per million for methylmercury in fish--
                    (A) is out of date; and
                    (B) according to scientific evidence, does not 
                adequately protect pregnant women and young children;
            (6) the comprehensive Mercury Study Report to Congress 
        issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in December 1997 
        recommended a methylmercury consumption limit of 0.1 micrograms 
        per kilogram of body weight per day, which is 5 times lower 
        than the Food and Drug Administration's current action level;
            (7) the report entitled ``Toxicological Effects of 
        Methylmercury'', issued by the National Academy of Sciences in 
        July 2000, confirmed that the Environmental Protection Agency's 
        limit is ``scientifically justifiable for the protection of 
        public health'';
            (8) the report entitled ``Food Safety: Federal Oversight of 
        Seafood Does Not Sufficiently Protect Consumers'', issued by 
        the General Accounting Office in February 2001, highlights the 
        inadequacies of Food and Drug Administration guidance regarding 
        methylmercury in commercial seafood;
            (9) many States have been forced to issue mercury 
        advisories for inland waterways and health warnings regarding 
        the fish that may be caught in those waterways; and
            (10) some States have also issued mercury advisories for 
        commercial seafood.

SEC. 3. TOLERANCE FOR METHYLMERCURY IN SEAFOOD.

    Chapter IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.

        the extent of compliance with the tolerance under subsection 
        (a).
            ``(2) Monitoring.--The sampling system shall provide 
        statistically valid monitoring (including market-basket 
        studies) with respect to compliance with the tolerance.
            ``(3) Avoidance of duplication of effort.--To the extent 
        practicable, the sampling system shall be consistent with, and 
        shall be coordinated with, other seafood sampling systems that 
        are in use, so as to avoid duplication of effort.

            ``(1) Public education.--The Secretary, in cooperation with 
        private and public organizations (including cooperative

    This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Nutrition Act of 2002''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) senior citizens in the United States have significant 
        out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses, especially for 
        prescription drugs;
            (2) 3 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries do not have dependable, 
        affordable, prescription drug coverage;
            (3) as medical costs continue to rise, many senior citizens 
        are forced to make the difficult choice between purchasing 
        prescription drugs and purchasing food;
            (4) the commodity supplemental food program provides 
        supplemental nutritious foods to senior citizens in a number of 
        States and localities;
            (5) under the commodity supplemental food program--
                    (A) women, infants, and children with household 
                incomes up to 185 percent of the Federal Poverty Income 
                Guidelines published annually by the Department of 
                Health and Human Services may be eligible for 
                supplemental foods; but
                    (B) senior citizens are ineligible for supplemental 
                foods if their household incomes are greater than 130 
                percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines;
            (6) during fiscal year 2000--
                    (A) an average of more than 388,000 people each 
                month participated in the commodity supplemental food 
                program; and
                    (B) the majority of those participants, 293,000, 
                were senior citizens; and
            (7) in order to serve the neediest senior citizens, taking 
        into account their high out-of-pocket medical (including 
        prescription drug) expenses, the eligibility requirements for 
        the commodity supplemental food program should be modified to 
        make more senior citizens eligible for the supplemental foods 
        provided under the program.

              FOOD PROGRAM.
