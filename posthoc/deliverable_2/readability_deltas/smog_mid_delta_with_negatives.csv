    The Congress finds that--

        to expand, to purchase new equipment, and to hire new workers;
            (2) the Nation's small business sector is expected to 
        create 70 percent of the new jobs in the United States in 1993;
            (3) a severe credit crunch is denying small businesses the 
        capital necessary to hire new workers and to grow; and
            (4) the cumulative burden of unnecessary Federal banking 
        regulations has served as a disincentive for small community 
        banks to lend to small businesses.

            (2) Regulatory impact analysis.--The term ``regulatory

        benefits to society of a proposed regulation, and in 
        particular, the costs to small banks and their customers.
            (3) Small bank.--The term ``small bank'' means a bank or

SEC. 5. NEW FEDERAL BANKING REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY IMPACT 
              ANALYSIS.

    (a) Regulatory Impact Analysis.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, no new regulation shall be promulgated by an appropriate 
        Federal banking agency until such agency has conducted a 
        regulatory impact analysis and concluded that the benefits of 
        the proposed regulation outweigh the costs of implementing and 
        complying with the regulation, including the particular 
        benefits and costs of compliance with the proposed regulation 
        for small banks.
            (2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, a 
        regulation shall be considered to be ``new'' if it is 
        promulgated, modified, amended, or reissued on or after the 
        date of enactment of this Act.
    (b) Costs.--In reviewing the costs of implementing and complying 
with a proposed regulation under subsection (a), the appropriate 
Federal banking agency shall consider the impact of the proposed 
regulation on--
            (1) the national economy (including the potential for job 
        creation);
            (2) consumers;
            (3) small businesses;
            (4) small banks (including administrative and personnel 
        costs);
            (5) other users of financial services; and
            (6) new paperwork and documentation requirements.
    (c) Benefits.--In reviewing the benefits of a proposed regulation 
under subsection (a), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall 
consider the benefits of the proposed regulation to--
            (1) the public;
            (2) taxpayers; and
            (3) the overall safety and soundness of the Nation's 
        banking system.
    (d) Easing Burden on Small Banks.--In conducting the regulatory 
impact analysis under subsection (a), the appropriate Federal banking 
agency shall consider including in the proposed regulation a provision 
that eases the regulatory burden on small banks, including special 
compliance provisions.
    (e) Estimate Required.--The regulatory impact analysis required by 
subsection (a) shall include an estimate of the number of small banks 
and small businesses that will be affected by the regulation.

SEC. 6. REVIEW OF STATUTORY AND REGULATORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING SMALL 
              BANKS.

    (a) In General.--Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall 
conduct a thorough review and evaluation of all--
            (1) statutory provisions affecting small banks; and
            (2) regulatory provisions affecting small banks that have 
        been promulgated by such appropriate Federal banking agency.
    (b) Review.--The review conducted pursuant to subsection (a) shall 
include--
            (1) an analysis of the purposes of the provision;
            (2) the effectiveness of the provision in achieving such 
        purposes;
            (3) whether any other provision provides an alternative or 
        duplicative means of achieving those purposes;
            (4) the cost imposed by compliance with such provisions 
        upon insured depository institutions and consumers; and
            (5) the relationship between such provision, compliance 
        costs, and the availability of credit in the United States.
    (c) Suspension.--If an appropriate Federal banking agency makes a 
determination described in subsection (d), the appropriate Federal 
banking agency shall--
            (1) not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, submit a written recommendation to the Congress to 
        suspend the applicability of any law that affects small banks 
        (or any portion thereof); and
            (2) not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, suspend the applicability of any Federal regulation 
        or guideline promulgated by such appropriate Federal banking 
        agency that affects small banks (or any portion thereof).
    (d) Determination.--For the purpose of subsection (c), a 
determination is described in this subsection if it is a determination 
by an appropriate Federal banking agency that--
            (1) the law, regulation, or guideline has already 
        accomplished its goal and is therefore no longer necessary;
            (2) the law, regulation, or guideline is not as effective 
        in achieving its intended purpose as other available 
        alternatives that would impose lesser costs on small banks, 
        their customers, or the economy;
            (3) the cost of compliance with the law, regulation, or 
        guideline outweighs the potential benefits sought to be 
        accomplished by the law, regulation, or guideline; or
            (4) the law, regulation, or guideline has an adverse impact 
        on the availability of credit in the United States which 
        substantially outweighs the benefits sought to be accomplished 
        by the law, regulation, or guideline.
    (e) Publication and Effective Date.--Any suspension of the 
applicability of any Federal regulation or guideline pursuant to 
subsection (c)(2) shall be published in the Federal Register, and shall 
become effective 30 days after the date of such publication, unless the 
appropriate Federal banking agency, for good cause, determines that a 
shorter period is necessary and in the public interest.
    (f) Consultation and Notification.--
            (1) Consultation.--In making a determination under 
        subsection (d), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall 
        consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairperson of 
        the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Chairman of the 
        Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the 
        Comptroller of the Currency, and the Director of the Office of 
        Thrift Supervision.
            (2) Notification.--The appropriate Federal banking agency 
        shall notify the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
        Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and 
        Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives prior to 
        suspending the applicability of a regulation or guideline under 
        subsection (c)(2).
    (g) Restriction.--Nothing in this section authorizes an appropriate 
Federal banking agency to recommend the suspension of any law, or to 
suspend any regulation or guideline--
            (1) that is necessary for the safe and sound operation of 
        insured depository institutions; or
            (2) that--
                    (A) prohibits discrimination in the provision of 
                financial services based on race, sex, national origin, 
                marital status, or age;
                    (B) relates directly to the conduct of monetary 
                policy; or

Accountability Restoration Act of 1999''.

SEC. 2. USE OF INCENTIVES TO RESTORE FOREST SERVICE FINANCIAL 
              ACCOUNTABILITY.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Section 3521(e) of title 31, United States Code, 
        requires the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture 
        to audit the annual financial statements required to be 
        prepared by the Forest Service. As a result of the inability of 
        the Forest Service to produce reliable financial statements, 
        the agency has received four successive adverse opinions or 
        disclaimers from the Inspector General.
            (2) In January 1999, the Comptroller General submitted a 
        report to Congress that identified the Forest Service as an 
        agency at ``high risk'' of waste, fraud, abuse, and 
        mismanagement due to the persistent and severe weaknesses in 
        the Forest Service's accounting and financial reporting 
        systems.
            (3) The Comptroller General has stated that the Forest 
        Service will maintain its high risk status until the agency, at 
        a minimum--
                    (A) receives two consecutive unqualified audit 
                opinions from the Inspector General; and
                    (B) corrects the material internal control 
                weaknesses, identified in the Inspector General's audit 
                reports of the financial statements of the Forest 
                Service, which adversely affect the ability of the 
                Forest Service to maintain accountability over its 
                assets on an ongoing basis.
            (4) Despite initial efforts on the part of the Forest 
        Service to correct deficiencies in its financial management 
        systems, the Comptroller General and the Inspector General of 
        the Department of Agriculture have indicated that the Forest 
        Service may still be years away from producing reliable 
        financial statements or changing its high risk status.
            (5) Performance incentives are necessary to ultimately 
        restore financial accountability to the Forest Service, and 
        such incentives must be structured so as to preserve the 
        ability of the Forest Service to perform its core missions, 
        particularly a sustained reduction of the natural resources 
        restoration and maintenance backlog within the National Forest 
        System, while safeguarding further investments of taxpayer 
        dollars from waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.
    (b) Conditional Limitations on Forest Service Appropriations.--
Subject to subsections (c) and (d), for fiscal years beginning after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the total amount appropriated 
for the Forest Service to carry out discretionary programs and 
activities for a fiscal year shall not exceed the sum of the amounts 
appropriated under the heading ``Forest Service'' in title II of the 
Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 
1999 (as contained in section 101(e) of division A of Public Law 105-
277; 112 Stat. 2681-268).
    (c) Removal of Condition.--The limitations on the level of Forest 
Service appropriations or obligations specified in subsection (b) shall 
terminate on the earlier of the following:
            (1) The date on which the Forest Service is no longer an 
        agency at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement 
        due to weaknesses in its accounting and financial reporting 
        systems, as determined under subsection (d).
            (2) The end of the fifth fiscal year subject to the 
        limitations.
    (d) Criteria for Removal of High Risk Status.--The Forest Service 
shall no longer be an agency at high risk under subsection (c)(1) if 
the Comptroller General certifies in writing to Congress that Forest 
Service financial management is no longer at high risk. The Comptroller
