SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) probabilistic methods have wide applicability in 
        improving process efficiency and eliminating overdesign in 
        government programs and purchases;
            (2) the integration of probabilistic methods into business 
        practices has contributed significantly to the success of 
        industry quality programs and has saved billions of dollars for 
        companies;
            (3) Federal use of probabilistic methods is less advanced 
        than it is in industry;
            (4) probabilistic methods hold out the promise of better 
        understanding of safety and environmental risks, and if 
        properly applied can lead to more business-friendly 
        regulations;
            (5) if made an integral part of federally funded design 
        efforts, probabilistic methods could lead to a better 
        understanding of the specifications a product must meet and 
        reduce overdesign and associated costs; and
            (6) appropriate use of probabilistic methods within the 
        programs of the Department of Transportation could lead through 
        quantification of uncertainties to more reliable, less costly 
        components of our transportation system, including roads, 
        bridges, and automotive, aerospace, and mass transit systems, 
        and could also benefit the programs of other Federal agencies 
        such as the Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce, 
        and the National Institutes of Health.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.

    The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs 
Administration of the Department of Transportation (in this Act 
referred to as the ``Administrator'') shall establish a commission to 
be known as the ``Commission on Probabilistic Methods'' (in this Act 
referred to as the ``Commission'').

SEC. 4. DUTIES OF COMMISSION.

    The Commission shall--
            (1) identify where and how probabilistic methods can help 
        the Department of Transportation;
            (2) assess the extent to which probabilistic methods can 
        help the Department of Transportation maximize return on 
        investment and increase public safety;
            (3) evaluate the state of probabilistic methods technology;
            (4) identify the probabilistic techniques that are ready 
        for practical use and recommend guidelines that can help a user 
        decide what technique to use;
            (5) establish models for quantifying uncertainties in major 
        Department of Transportation programs that affect cost, 
        operation, and performance;
            (6) identify key technology areas that must be further 
        developed;
            (7) recommend guidelines for implementation of 
        probabilistic technology;
            (8) recommend how to set reliability levels that can ensure 
        public safety and be achievable by industry;
            (9) recommend probabilistic-based guidelines for safety 
        tests;
            (10) recommend guidelines for creating required database;
            (11) determine appropriate means of expediting technology 
        transfer and ensuring that the principles of probabilistic 
        methods are used appropriately in decisions involving funds 
        under the control of the Department of Transportation;
            (12) identify legal and cultural barriers to the effective
