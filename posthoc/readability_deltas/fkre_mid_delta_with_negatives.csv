SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) by enacting the Act of December 22, 1944, commonly 
        known as the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'' (58 Stat. 887, 
        chapter 665; 33 U.S.C. 701-1 et seq.) Congress approved the 
        Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program (referred to in this 
        section as the ``Pick-Sloan program'')--
                    (A) to promote the general economic development of 
                the United States;
                    (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, 
                Iowa;
                    (C) to protect urban and rural areas from 
                devastating floods of the Missouri River; and
                    (D) for other purposes;
            (2) the waters impounded for the Fort Randall and Gavins 
        Point projects of the Pick-Sloan program have inundated the 
        fertile, wooded bottom lands along the Missouri River that 
        constituted the most productive agricultural and pastoral lands 
        of, and the homeland of, the members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe 
        and the Santee Sioux Tribe;
            (3) the Fort Randall project (including the Fort Randall 
        Dam and Reservoir) overlies the western boundary of the Yankton 
        Sioux Tribe Indian Reservation;
            (4) the Gavins Point project (including the Gavins Point 
        Dam and Reservoir) overlies the eastern boundary of the Santee 
        Sioux Tribe;
            (5) although the Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects are 
        major components of the Pick-Sloan program, and contribute to 
        the economy of the United States by generating a substantial 
        amount of hydropower and impounding a substantial quantity of 
        water, the reservations of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the 
        Santee Sioux Tribe remain undeveloped;
            (6) the United States Army Corps of Engineers took the 
        Indian lands used for the Fort Randall and Gavins Point 
        projects by condemnation proceedings;
            (7) the Federal Government did not give the Yankton Sioux 
        Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe an opportunity to receive 
        compensation for direct damages from the Pick-Sloan program, 
        even though the Federal Government gave 5 Indian reservations 
        upstream from the reservations of those Indian tribes such an 
        opportunity;
            (8) the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe did 
        not receive just compensation for the taking of productive 
        agricultural Indian lands through the condemnation referred to 
        in paragraph (6);
            (9) the settlement agreement that the United States entered 
        into with the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe to 
        provide compensation for the taking by condemnation referred to 
        in paragraph (6) did not take into account the increase in 
        property values over the years between the date of taking and 
        the date of settlement; and
            (10) in addition to the financial compensation provided 
        under the settlement agreements referred to in paragraph (9)--
                    (A) the Yankton Sioux Tribe should receive an 
                aggregate amount equal to $23,023,743 for the loss 
                value of 2,851.40 acres of Indian land taken for the 
                Fort Randall Dam and Reservoir of the Pick-Sloan 
                program; and
                    (B) the Santee Sioux Tribe should receive an 
                aggregate amount equal to $4,789,010 for the loss value 
                of 593.10 acres of Indian land located near the Santee

        has aimed to encourage citizens to form Neighborhood Watch 
        groups in their local communities to bolster homeland security.
            (5) Citizens in local communities should be encouraged and 
        empowered to engage in homeland security activities to reduce 
        the threat to homeland security from terrorism.

                efforts; and
                    (C) educate citizens on how to prevent, and respond 
                to, possible terrorist attacks.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) To provide each community in each city, suburb, and
