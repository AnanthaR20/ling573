"That this Act may be cited as the Federal Forage Fee Act of 1993''. Findings.--Congress finds and declares that-- it is in the national interest that the public lands are producing and continue to produce water and soil conservation benefits, livestock forage. Wildlife forage and recreation and other multiple use opportunities are available in rangelands. Rangelands will continue to be stabilized and improved long term by providing for cooperative agreements, private, public. The stewardship of renewable resources requires partnerships and flexibility in management programs and agreements. To assure sound management and stewardship of the renewable resources it is imperative to charge a fee that is reasonable. The intermingled private-public land ownership patterns prevailing in much of the west create a strong interdependence between public and private land ownership. The fair value of the forage provided is equitable and represents the fair value of the forage provided. The social and economic infrastructure of many rural communities and stability of job opportunities in many areas of rural communities are important factors in the development of rural communities. Private lands are used for forage, water, and habitat for both wildlife and livestock. Rural America is highly independent on the protection of the value of privately held production units on Federal lands.

The western livestock grazing survey was conducted in 1966. The western livestock grazing rate is $1.78. The Federal forage fee is calculated annually by calculating the average of the WALLPR for the preceding three years. The Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior shall calculate the Federal forage fee by calculating the average of the WALLPR for the preceding three years. The nonfee cost differential is deducted from the nonfee cost differential. The nonfee cost differential is multiplied by the net production differential. For each year that this calculation is made, all data used for calculating this fee shall come from the calendar year preceding the year for which the fee is being calculated unless specified. Otherwise in the above calculations. The Federal forage fee shall apply to all authorized Federal AUMs under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture.

For each year after the first year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal forage fee, the fee shall not be less than 75 percent of the Federal forage fee calculated. For the previous year. The survey of nonfee costs used to calculate the nonfee cost differential shall be updated periodically by the Secretaries so as to reflect as accurately as possible the actual nonfee costs incurred. The cattle and sheep industry utilizes public lands in the Western States. The cattle and sheep industry is one of the industries in the Western States. The results of the updated survey shall be incorporated into the calculation of the Non Fee Cost Differential."
